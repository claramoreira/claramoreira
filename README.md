### Hi there :smiley:


My name is Clara and I'm from Brazil. I like to work on Front-End projects, but I'm also enjoying Data Science right now. I'm currently working at Hexing as a Product Manager and I'm a Machine Learning/Software Engineering student at PUC Minas. 

If you wanna work on some Machine Learning projects together, please reach out. ðŸ‘‹

In my free time, I like to play board games (:game_die:) and videogames (:video_game:) with my friends and (try to) play the guitar(:guitar:). My favourite online games are League of Legends (:punch:)and Age of Empires II (:crown:). My favourite game of all times is Life is Strange (:camera:).
